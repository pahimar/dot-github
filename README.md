Just another generic GitHub repository template for all :smile:

## Overview

In [June of 2019](https://github.blog/2019-06-06-generate-new-repositories-with-repository-templates/) GitHub announced repository templates, which allow for people/organizations to use template repositories as a [boilerplate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boilerplate_text) to quickly generate new GitHub repositories. I wanted to put together a (mostly) language agnostic repository template for my own projects, and hope that others may benefit from this work.

## Features

This repository template includes;

- An easily customizable boilerplate [README.md](./BOILERPLATE_README.md) file that follows this one
- A [Code of Conduct](./.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
  - Adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org)
- An in-depth [Contribution](./.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) guide
- Support for [all-contributors](https://allcontributors.org/)
- Documentation for how people can get [support](./.github/SUPPORT.md)
- Templates for;
  - [Bug Reports](./.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/BUG_REPORT.md)
  - [Feature Requests](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/FEATURE_REQUEST.md)
  - [Pull Requests](./.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)
- Pre-configured [editorconfig](https://editorconfig.org/), [gitattributes](https://www.git-scm.com/docs/gitattributes), and [gitingore](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore) files
- Suggested [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) extensions for faster IDE setup

## Usage

The steps to use this template repository in your own projects are;

1. [Create a new repository](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) using this template
2. Rename this `README.md` file to something else, such as `TEMPLATE_README.md`
3. Rename the provided `BOILERPLATE_README.md` to `README.md`
4. Replace instances of `YOUR_*` in your new `README.md` to customize the [shields](https://shields.io/), social links, etc to yourself and your project
   1. `YOUR_NAME` - Your name (ie, John Doe)
   2. `YOUR_GITHUB_NAME` - Your GitHub user name (ie, `github.com/<user_name>`)
   3. `YOUR_GITHUB_REPO` - Your GitHub repository name (ie, `github.com/<user_name>/<repository_name>`)
   4. `YOUR_TWITTER_NAME` - Your Twitter user name (ie, `twitter.com/<your_name>`)
   5. `YOUR_PATREON_NAME` - Your Patreon name (ie, `patreon.com/<your_name>`)
   6. `YOUR_DISCORD_SERVER_ID` - Your Discord server id (follow the steps [in this video](https://vimeo.com/364220040) to set up widget permissions on your server and get your server id)
5. Customize the rest of the repository to your hearts content
6. Start creating!
